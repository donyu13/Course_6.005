+ Mutability
    - immutable: once created, represent the same value
    - mutable: with methods to change value

+ Mutable obj
    + e.g. iterator
        - used under the covers in Java for loop through a collection
        - private final list; private int index;
        - mutations destroy iterator

+ Aliasing
    - is with multiple references
    - makes mutability dangerous

+ Danger of mutability
    - pass mutable values
    - return mutable values

+ spec for mutating methods

+ Mutation and contracts
    - complicate the contract
    - reduce changeability

+ Immutability to improve correctness, clarity and changeability
    SO using immutable objects and immutable references as much as possible
