[Summary]
Part 1: Recursive Data Types
In addition to the big idea of recursive datatypes, we saw in this reading:
- datatype definitions: a powerful way to think about abstract types, particularly recursive ones
- functions over recursive datatypes: declared in the specification for the type, and implemented with one case per concrete variant
- immutable lists: a classic, canonical example of an immutable datatype
Part 1 & Part 2: 
- Safe from bugs. Recursive datatypes allow us to tackle problems with a recursive or unbounded structure. 
                  Implementing appropriate data structures that encapsulate important operations and maintain their own invariants is crucial for correctness.
- Easy to understand. Functions over recursive datatypes, specified in the abstract type and implemented in each concrete variant, organize the different behavior of the type.
- Ready for change. A recursive ADT, like any ADT, separates abstract values from concrete representations, making it possible to change low-level code and high-level structure of the implementation without changing clients.

Part 1: Recursive Data Types
- as Recursive Funcs, we need base and recursive cases

- Immutable Lists ImList<E>
    first(cons(elt,lst)) = elt
    rest(cons(elt,lst)) = lst
    What cons putstogether, first and rest peel back part.
    
- Recursive Datatype Definitions
    ImList<E> = Empty + Cons(first: E, rest: ImList)
    Tree<E> = Empty + Node(E, left: Tree<E>, right: Tree<E>)
    
- Functions over recursive datatypes
    step 1. declaring the operation in the abstract datatype interface
    step 2. implementing the operation (recursively) in each concrete variant
    e.g. 
    + isEmpty: ImList -> boolean
    isEmpty(Empty) = true
    isEmpty(Cons(first: E, rest: ImList)) = false
    + contains: ImList x E -> boolean
    contains(Empty) = false
    contains(Cons(first: E, rest: ImList), e: E) = (first == e) || contains(rest, e)

- Tuning the rep
    make size() from O(n) to O(1) by caching size the first time we compute it
    
- Null vs. empty
    object rather than null reference => sentinel objects, which we can call methods on it, e.g. size()
    n = lst.size() is better than if (lst != null) n = lst.size();
    
- Declared type vs. actual type
    + compile time before the program runs
        every var has a declared type
    + run time when program is executing
        every var has an actual type (by constructor)
        
- Boolean formulas example    
    Formula = Variable(name: String)
                + Not(formula: Formula)
                + And(left: Formula, right: Formula)
                + Or(left: Formula, right: Formula)
    e.g.
        (P ∨ Q) ∧ (¬P ∨ R) IS
        And( Or(Variable("P"), Variable("Q")),
             Or(Not(Variable("P")), Variable("R") )

Part 2. Writing a Program with ADT
Q: If we need instanceof in OOP
A: Break the op down into pieces that are appropriate for each class, and write instance methods instead
Q: If we need a value in the datatype that represents nothing
A: Avoid using null. e.g. for a matrix product, identity matrix - an empty product expression is just the identity anyway.
Q: If we don't want to expose concrete rep classes, so that clients won't depend on them and we'll be able to change them later (being ready to change)
A: Factory methods - static methods that play the role of constructors.

/**
 * static .. make() - Factory Methods
 * default .. times() - default methods
 * isIdentity impl. - avoid instanceOf
 * I = new Identity() - avoid null
