Make thread safety arguments about your datatypes, and document them in the code.
Acquiring a lock allows a thread to have exclusive access to the data guarded by that lock, forcing other threads to block â€” as long as those threads are also trying to acquire that same lock.
The monitor pattern guards the rep of a datatype with a single lock that is acquired by every method.
Blocking caused by acquiring multiple locks creates the possibility of deadlock.
=========
- Thread Safety: the correctness of a concurrent program should not depend on accidents of timing
- way 4, synchronization (safe for shared-memory concurrency)
    + technique:
        - locks, guard access to shared data variable
            at most one thread to own it at a time
            operations:
                acquire
                release
- deadlock
    - what:
        Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. 
        when concurrent modules are stuck waiting for each other to do sth (can be cycle of dependencies)
    - why:
        locks require threads to wait (acquire blocks while held by others)
   
    
    
- dev a threadsafe ADT
- locking in Java
    each obj WITH intrinsic/monitor LOCK 
    SO impossible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same objs to interleave
       establish a happen-before relationship with any subsequent sync methods
    SO a thread to own it have to ACQUIRE the lock and RELEASE afterwards
    synchronized regions mutual exclusion like in sequential programming world
  + Sync Method
    BUT what about STATIC sync method, which belongs to class rather than obj
        acuires the lock for the CLASS obj associated with the class RATHER THAN lock for INSTANCE of the class
  + Sync Statements
    MUST specify the object providing lock
    e.g.
        synchronized(lock) { // Block here until lock is free.
            // Has lock.
            balance++;
            // Exiting the block releases the lock.
        }
  + Reentrant Sync
    a thread can acquire a lock it already owns ENABLES Reentrant Sync
    use it when you actually need something it provides that synchronized doesn't, 
        like timed lock waits, interruptible lock waits, non-block-structured locks...
        
- Monitor pattern
    most convenient lock is the object instance itself, i.e. this
    a monitor is a class whose methods are mutually exclusive, only one thread can be inside an instance of the class at a time
    
- Thread safety argument with sync
    + locking discipline
        to ensure sync code is threadsafe, we satisfy
            - shared mutable var guarded by lock
            - if an invariant involves n shared mutable ars, garded by same lock
        Monitor pattern satisfies above
- Atomic operations
    - give clients access to a lock
    - don't sync everywhere
- Designing a datatype for concurrency
- Deadlock occurs
    when threads acquire multiple locks at the same time, and two threads end up blocked while holding locks that they are each waiting for the other to release
    solution:
        - lock ordering
            put an ordering on the locks
            because in order to encounter deadlock, 
                threads must try to acquire locks in different orders, creating a cycle in the graph of who-is-waiting-for-who
        - coarse-grained locking
            a single lock to guard many object instances, or even a whole subsystem of a program
- Goals of concurrent program design
    ask yourself
        safety - bad thing never happen
        liveness - goot thing eventually happens
- Concurrency in practice
    - Library data structures use
        no sync OR monitor pattern
    - Mutable data structure with many parts use (e.g. GUI, Java Swing)
        coarse locking OR thread confinement
    - Search use
        immutable datatypes
    - OS use
        fine locking AND lock ordering
 another solution for mutable shared data -> db, avoid race conditions using transactions, no need to acquire locks
         a transaction may fail and be rolled back if it turns out that a race occurred
