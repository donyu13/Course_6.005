- what Thread Safe
behaves correctly: satisfy spec and preserve rep invariant
regardless of how threads executed
w/o additional coordination like you can't call get() while set() in progress
- how Thread Safe
    + Confinement
        keep mutable data(pointed) confined to a single thread w/o sharing e.g. local variables
